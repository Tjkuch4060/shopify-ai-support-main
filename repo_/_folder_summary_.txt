## Development Workflow

### Local Development
```bash
npm run dev                 # Start development server
npm run build              # Build for production
```

### Deployment
```bash
npm run deploy             # Deploy to Vercel
npm run deploy:prod        # Production deployment
```

## Current Limitations

### Missing Production Features
- **No Persistent Storage**: Leads are only logged, not stored in database
- **Placeholder Analytics**: Google Tag and Meta Pixel IDs need replacement
- **No Authentication**: Lead management endpoint has no protection
- **No Email Integration**: No automated follow-up emails
- **Limited Error Handling**: Basic validation but could be more robust

### Development TODOs
- Integrate D1 database or external CRM for lead storage
- Replace placeholder analytics IDs with real values
- Add comprehensive error handling and input validation
- Implement email automation for lead nurturing
- Add admin dashboard for lead management
- Set up proper monitoring and alerting

## Business Purpose

This landing page serves as a **lead generation funnel** for AI support services:

1. **Attracts** potential customers through SEO and marketing
2. **Educates** visitors about AI support automation benefits
3. **Demonstrates** value through interactive ROI calculator
4. **Captures** qualified leads with contact information
5. **Converts** leads through embedded booking calendar

The page is specifically designed for **Shopify store owners** who want to reduce customer support costs through AI automation.
